# DPC-Seq
Analysis of DPC-Seq data and plot generation

The dpcseq_pipe.sh is a shell script that handles upstream data processing starting at Illumina BCL files, through to fastq filtering, alignment, sorting and coverage calculations.

The dpcseq_plots.R is the R script used to conduct further analysis and data integration and finally generates the different plot types used for DPC-seq analysis.
